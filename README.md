# Image Classification with Gradio

This project implements an image classification model using a pre-trained neural network and provides a web interface using Gradio.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `torch`: For building and training the model.
- `torchvision`: For image transformations and pre-trained models.
- `gradio`: For creating the web interface.
- `Pillow`: For image processing.

Make sure to give the correct path in the .py file attched

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
